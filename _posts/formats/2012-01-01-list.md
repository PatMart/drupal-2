Lists cover a wide range of use cases for Drupal's output from menus to content listings.  There are numerous theme functions that output lists and parts of those lists.  Unfortunately, this means a lot of theme functions to override when trying to provide a consistent experience. Ideally, we would have one theme function that takes care of outputting all lists, by satisfying the basic requirements that are common among most lists.

## Examples

{% include examples/unordered-list.html %}
{% include examples/ordered-list.html %}


## Requirements

- Ability to choose from `<ol>` or `<ul>` list type, with `<ul>` being the default.
- Provide *optional* helper classes to the `<ul>` and `<li>` and children elements.
    - Provide `.active` class when child element links to the current path.
    - Provide `.active-trail` class when child element links to a parent of the current path.
- Include HTML or Plain text in the `<li>`.
- Ability to include nested lists and/or other nested content.
- Ability to determine whether the list contents container rendered children and what the current and total depth is.
- Ability to modify the default implementation per instance of the list, with theme hook suggestions or something similar.
