There isn't much markup "structure" provided here, but that is by design. The idea is not to do too much by default, but allow the front-end developer to easily define the structure if needed *(yes, that's right - it's the front end developers choice to **add** markup)*. This simple pattern can apply to a variety of different use cases in a clean and consistent manner.

- `$item` makes up rendered style types, similar to field formatters.
- More than one `$item` can be used to make up a piece of `$content`.
- More often than not, extra "container" markup is not required to get the job done when dealing with nested `$items`. If a `$container` is needed, the structural <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/containers.html">container</a> component should be used to wrap it.

### item.tpl.php
{% highlight php item.tpl.php %}<?php print render($items); ?>{% endhighlight %}

## Requirements

- No wrapper markup. Formats should be used wherever possible.
- Even though they are not printed in this example, `$attributes`, `$item_attributes` and the rest of the variables here should be available.
- Theme hook suggestions or some similar functionality should be enabled for each instance so it's possible to customize. More information will be provided for suggested default formats/components.

## Simple Examples

{% highlight html %}
<a href="#">one</a> | <a href="#">two</a> | <a href="#">three</a>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
one, two, three
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<img src="#" alt="one">
<img src="#" alt="two">
<img src="#" alt="three">
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<label for="one">Label for one</label>
<input type="text" name="one">
<div class="description">Some form element description.</div>
{% endhighlight %}
