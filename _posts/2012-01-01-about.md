The goals of this effort are to:

- Simplify Drupal's theme system in order to make it easier and logical to approach.
- Provide common patterns so that developers may use them instead of constantly rolling their own.
- Separate content (items) from the container (structure) so they can be easily swapped and mashed up without a slew of extra markup.
- Provide more in-depth coding standards and best practices to better equip developers to generate quality output.

By using patterns we can hopefully streamline the code, giving the themer more control, and the ability to make sweeping changes without drastic consequences.


## Contributing

This is still a fairly new effort, and very much a work in progress. The main tasks at hand right now are:

1. Gathering as many common formats and patterns as we possibly can.
2. Nailing down the requirements of them.
3. Getting examples in for everything listed the sidebar already.
4. Write up usage guidelines for the patterns.


This information is important, whether or not it ends up being a candidate for core so that we can analyze them and provide the best data structure.

The code that makes up this project is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted [Github Pages][gh-pages]. It uses [Sass][sass], [Compass][compass] and [Susy][susy] for CSS. See the README instructions on the project's [Github page][project] for more information.
